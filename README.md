# Internal Audit Project – ISO/IEC 27001 Checklist

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simplified **internal audit and risk assessment** approach using the **ISO/IEC 27001 framework**.  
It was designed as an hands-on exercise to practice **audit documentation, evidence collection, and compliance gap analysis**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls**  
- Build a **basic audit checklist** for selected controls  
- Perform a **risk-based compliance review** (Yes / No / Partial)  
- Document findings and highlight potential gaps  

---

## Methodology
1. Selected **7 key ISO/IEC 27001 controls** (e.g., Access Control, Encryption, Backup, Incident Response, Logging).  
2. Created an **audit checklist** with the following columns:  
   - Control Name  
   - Evidence Required  
   - Compliance Status (Yes/No/Partial)  
3. Simulated audit results for a sample organization.  
4. Summarized gaps and suggested corrective actions.  

---

## Deliverables
- **Audit Checklist (Excel)** – ISO27001_Audit_Checklist.xlsx  
- **Report (PDF)** – Findings and gap analysis  

---

## Key Learnings
- Exposure to **audit documentation** and **risk assessment techniques**  
- Hands-on practice with **compliance frameworks** (ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HiTrust CSF)  
- Experience in **reporting audit findings** and proposing remediation  

---

## Future Scope
This project can be extended by:  
- Adding more frameworks (**PCI DSS, SOC 2**)  
- Automating checklist scoring using Excel formulas or Python  
- Building a **compliance dashboard** for visualization
